  how to use this
  when the chip first runs it prints team numbers and using them we can make printGlobal what we say as their rank 
  the server i made this on had custom chat tags so you may have to do some editing to printGlobal to make it look like the server you're on
  requires VExtensions at https://github.com/Vurv78/VExtensions

if(first()) {
  print(teams())
  print(teamName(21))
}
runOnChat(1)
if(chatClk(owner())) {
    hideChat(1)
    Teamnumber = 21
    printGlobal(vec(0),"[",teamColor(Teamnumber),teamName(Teamnumber),vec(0),"] ",teamColor(Teamnumber),owner():name(),vec(255),": ",lastSaid())
}
